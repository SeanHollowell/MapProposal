        <h3>Cartography II GEOG<br/> 3610/5610<br /> Ana Mojica Myers <br> Proposal by Sean Hollowell</h3>
        <h1>Writing your project proposal</h1>
        <p>This project will explore the relationship between Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) and social vulnerability to environmental hazard in the United States to better understand how WUI may be a factor in various environmental hazards. I will analyze the distribution of WUI in the United States and how it compares to patterns of social vulnerability to identify any trends between WUI and social vulnerability. Additionally, real hazard loss data will be presented to further characterize the greater environmental hazard risks present in WUI areas. I hope to show the value of thinking about WUI outside of the lone context of wildfire, and to better understand how the characteristics of WUI relate to disaster risk.</p>
         <ol>
             <li><i class="heading">Describing the purpose of the map.</i> My project focuses on the idea of wildfire risk and hazard. With this project I seek to provide a good viual tool for looking at the distribution of wildfire risk in the country and how it relates to a few variables. One important concept that will be included is the concept of Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI). WUI is basically where naturalized areas like forest or grassland meet human development. These are typically rural areas and have been extensively studied as a factor in wildfire risk and management. My map is intended for anyone interested in the topic, it will not require special knowledge. However, it should me noted that this map will ideally serve as a vidual aid in my ongoing senior thesis.In creating this map I hope to better understand the strucuture of websites and how to create custom tools to serve my needs and those of any future jobs I have that could utilize web maps. This map will have 3 main datasets: the WUI data showing where it exists, a county-level dataset that shows reltive environmental vulnerability, and a county-level dataset showing the damamge in US dollars caused by fires in that county. I could potentially add any number of census variables if they become relevant to my thesis in the future. In this map I hope to include all the normal navigation features like zooms, seaching, panning and clicking for informative pop-ups. In the map frame itself, I would like the variable currently displayed to be changed with a button, or to use buttons/drop down menus to pick which two variables to compare geographically.</li>
             <li><i class="heading">The structure of the map.</i> WUI will be represented as a choropleth with different colors representing where it does and does not exist. I believe I should also symbolize the Social Vulnerability scores as a choropleth. To compare the two I could have the web map calculate the average vulnerability level inside vs outside of the WUI area. I plan to symbolize the damages as graduated symbols, and if I have data showing incidences of fires a heatmap would be a perfect overlay. there will certainly be ancillary text giving definitions for some of these concepts, and I think a table would be in order to describe the differences in the data being shown on the map. For example, the table could show how much of the country is covered by the two types of WUI.</li>
             <li><i class="heading">Data sources: </i>WUI data comes from the SILVIS lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and it is collected from both 2000 and 2010 at the census tract level. The Social Vulnerability data is from the University of South Carolina's Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute and it is of the county level, generated from 2010 census data and some predictions from 2014. The evironmental hazard damage data comes from the SHELDUS dataset managed by Arizona State University. This dataset is a paid subscription service.</li>
             <li><i class="heading">Methodology:</i> For this map I will first need to import the Social Vulnerability scores, which are in the form of a table, into ArcPro. Then I will have to append this data onto a dataset of US counties by the FIPS code. Since county level FIPS are unique at the national level when paired with the state FIPS code this should be no problem. I may have to go through a similar process with the hazard damages data. The other important process I should do is to try to aggregate my WUI data up to the county level. I think I can take an average of all the census tracts in a county and determine which counties are majority WUI to use in this map.</li>
